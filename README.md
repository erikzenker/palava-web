# palava | web

[palava](https://github.com/palavatv/palava) is a cost-free, simple to use, secure, and open source platform for video calls, built on top of the [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) technology.

This repository contains the front-end web application of [palava.tv](https://palava.tv). It replaces the former [palava-portal](https://github.com/palavatv/palava-portal).

## Setup

Make sure you have NodeJS and the YARN package manager installed. Then run:

    $ yarn install

You can then start the application on localhost:8080 using this command:

    $ yarn serve

To build the static production version of the page, use:

    $ yarn build

## Configuration

The following ENV variables can be passed to the above commands, or configured via an `.env.local` file:

### `VUE_APP_RTC_URL`

Sets the location to the palava signaling server. By default, it tries to reach a local [signaltower](https://github.com/farao/signaltower/) (or [palava-machine](https://github.com/palavatv/palava-machine/)) on port 4233. To use the palava.tv signaling server, start with:

     VUE_APP_RTC_URL=wss://machine.palava.tv yarn serve

### `VUE_APP_STUN_URL`

The (required) [STUN server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN) to use, defaults to `stun: stun:stun.palava.tv`
